The project depends on `themis` library binaries.
The version has been pinned to `v0.13.2`.

Other versions can be found in tags and branches
* `v0.13.2`
* `v0.12.0`

### How to build and run

1. Open `app/ThemisDemoXamarin.sln` in VisualSturio (either windows or mac)
2. Select `ThemisDemoXamarin.iOS` or `ThemisDemoXamarin.Android` with `Set as Startup project`
3. Build and run
4. Look into console logs.
5. **Note:** on android search for `[themis demo]` prefix since the system generates a lot of other logs


### Prototype notes:

For convenience the dependencies have been committed into this git repo since it is a prototype and is not supposed to be changed frequently.
If you need later versions, please do the following steps:
1. update `Cartfile` in `lib-native/ios` directory
2. update java `*.aar` package links in `scripts/download-binaries-droid.sh`
3. run `configure.sh` which will download artefacts from the internet

```
No windows scripts yet but please feel free to send a pull request.
```

## If you are planning to build your project on top of this prototype
```
Do not commit binaries and artefacts to your repo
```

* *.framework ios artefacts 
* Carthage directory binary contents
*  *.aar packages
